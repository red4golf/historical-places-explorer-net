# Port Blakely Mill: From Forest to Fortune

Standing here in what is now a peaceful waterfront park, it's hard to imagine that this was once the site of one of the world's largest sawmills. From 1864 to 1922, the Port Blakely Mill transformed the landscape and economy of Bainbridge Island.

## The Early Days

In 1864, William Renton established the mill at this natural deep-water port. The location was ideal - protected waters, abundant timber, and easy access to shipping routes. By 1880, Port Blakely was shipping lumber to California, Hawaii, Australia, and beyond.

## The Mill at its Peak

At its height, the Port Blakely Mill was the world's largest sawmill under one roof. The mill employed hundreds of workers from diverse backgrounds, including Japanese, Native American, and European immigrants. This created a unique multicultural community that flourished around the mill.

## Legacy

Though the mill closed in 1922, its impact on Bainbridge Island's development was permanent. The site you're standing on helped build San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and shaped the early Pacific Northwest economy.

## What to Look For

As you walk the beach today, look for:
- Old pilings visible at low tide
- The natural deep-water harbor that made this location ideal
- The gentle slope where mill buildings once stood
- The creek that provided water power for early operations
