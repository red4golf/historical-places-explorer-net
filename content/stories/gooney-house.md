# The Goonies House: A Cultural Landmark in Astoria

Standing proudly at 368 38th Street in Astoria, this 1896 Victorian home gained worldwide fame as the "Goonies House" after serving as a central location in the beloved 1985 film "The Goonies." The house represents both architectural history and popular culture, playing a crucial role in one of the most celebrated coming-of-age adventure films of the 1980s.

## Historical Significance

Built in 1896, this Victorian-era home exemplifies the residential architecture of late 19th century Astoria. The 2,336-square-foot house features three bedrooms and two bathrooms, maintaining many of its original architectural elements while gaining new significance through its connection to film history.

## The Goonies Legacy

The house became globally recognized after appearing in "The Goonies" (1985), where it served as the Walsh family home and the starting point for the film's treasure-hunting adventure. The film's cultural impact was officially recognized in 2017 when the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

## Preservation and Public Access

In January 2023, the house was purchased for $1.65 million by Behman Zakeri, a superfan committed to preserving its legacy. Unlike previous periods when public access was restricted, the new ownership has embraced the house's role in popular culture while maintaining respect for its historical integrity and the surrounding neighborhood.

## Visiting the Landmark

Today, the house stands as a testament to both architectural preservation and film history. Visitors can view the house from designated areas, though they should remember this is still a private residence and observe posted guidelines. The property's careful preservation ensures that future generations can continue to experience this unique intersection of historical architecture and popular culture.
