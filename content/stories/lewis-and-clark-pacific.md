# Lewis and Clark: Winter at the Pacific

Standing at the mouth of the Columbia River, you're at the culmination of one of America's greatest journeys of exploration. Here, in November 1805, Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and the Corps of Discovery first glimpsed their ultimate goal - the Pacific Ocean.

## The Final Push

After traveling over 4,000 miles from St. Louis, the expedition reached these shores in a cold November rain. Clark wrote in his journal, "Ocian in view! O! the joy!" Though they had reached their destination, their journey wasn't over - they still needed to survive a Pacific Northwest winter.

## Fort Clatsop

The expedition built Fort Clatsop, named after the local Clatsop tribe, in just three weeks. This sturdy wooden fort would be their home for three months. The location you see today is a careful reconstruction, showing how the original fort looked during that wet winter of 1805-1806.

## Winter Survival

The winter at Fort Clatsop was challenging:
- It rained all but 12 days of their stay
- The men hunted elk and deer for food and clothing
- They boiled seawater to make salt at what is now Seaside
- They traded with local Clatsop and Chinook peoples
- The expedition documented local plants, animals, and geography

## Native Relationships

The Clatsop and Chinook peoples were crucial to the expedition's survival:
- They provided valuable information about local resources
- They traded food and supplies
- They shared knowledge of the local geography
- Their villages were centers of regional trade

## Scientific Legacy

During their stay, Lewis and Clark documented:
- 95 new animal species
- 31 new plant species
- Detailed maps of the Columbia River region
- Extensive notes on Native American cultures
- Weather patterns and geographical features

## What to See Today

At the park, you can explore:
- A faithful reconstruction of Fort Clatsop
- The salt works site in Seaside
- Hiking trails following historic paths
- Native American cultural exhibits
- The stunning coastal landscape

## The Return Journey

On March 23, 1806, the expedition began their long journey home, leaving behind not just Fort Clatsop, but also the first detailed documentation of the Pacific Northwest's natural and cultural landscape.

Today, as you walk these grounds, you're experiencing the same landscapes that tested and amazed the Corps of Discovery. The fort's reconstruction helps us understand the challenges they faced, while the surrounding forest and coastline remain much as Lewis and Clark first saw them, providing a direct connection to this pivotal moment in American exploration.
