# Manhattan Project: Hanford and the Atomic Age

Standing in the desert landscape of eastern Washington, you're at the site of one of history's most consequential scientific undertakings. The Hanford Site, selected in 1943 for the Manhattan Project, would transform both the course of World War II and the future of human history.

## The Secret City

Virtually overnight, this remote stretch of desert became home to what was then the largest construction project in world history:
- 50,000 workers arrived to build and operate the facilities
- The nearby town of Richland transformed into a secret government city
- Workers weren't told what they were building - only that it would help end the war
- The project cost $230 million in 1943 dollars (equivalent to billions today)

## Why Hanford?

The site was chosen for specific reasons:
- The Columbia River provided abundant cold water for cooling
- The remote location offered security and secrecy
- The available electrical power from Grand Coulee Dam
- The stable geological conditions
- The sparse population that would need to be relocated

## The B Reactor

The B Reactor, the world's first full-scale plutonium production reactor, began operating in September 1944:
- It was the first reactor to produce plutonium at an industrial scale
- The reactor core contained 200 tons of uranium
- The building stood 120 feet high
- Its construction required revolutionary advances in nuclear physics and engineering

## The Human Story

The Manhattan Project at Hanford wasn't just about science and engineering:
- Native American tribes were displaced from their ancestral lands
- Farmers and townspeople were given 30 days to leave their homes
- Workers faced harsh conditions and strict secrecy
- Entire families moved to live in the newly-constructed government city
- The population of the area grew from 300 to 50,000 in just months

## Environmental Legacy

The rush to produce plutonium left an enduring environmental challenge:
- 56 million gallons of radioactive waste stored in underground tanks
- Contaminated groundwater plumes
- Ongoing cleanup efforts expected to continue for decades
- The site remains one of the world's largest environmental cleanup projects

## What to See Today

The Hanford Site today offers unique insights into this pivotal moment in history:
- The B Reactor National Historic Landmark is open for tours
- The Manhattan Project National Historical Park preserves key facilities
- The REACH Museum in Richland tells the area's story
- Original Hanford construction camp buildings
- Historic alphabet houses in Richland where workers lived

## Scientific Legacy

Hanford's impact on science and technology was profound:
- Advances in nuclear physics and engineering
- Development of radiation safety protocols
- Innovations in large-scale industrial processes
- Pioneering work in environmental cleanup technologies

## Looking Forward

Today, as you explore this historic site, you're witnessing both the technological triumph and the complex legacy of the atomic age. Hanford represents humanity's first steps into the nuclear era, serving as both a reminder of human ingenuity and a cautionary tale about the long-term consequences of our technological achievements.

The site continues to evolve, transforming from a weapons facility to a cleanup site and historic landmark, preserving this crucial chapter in world history for future generations to study and understand.
