# The Fremont Troll: A Guardian Under the Bridge

Lurking beneath Seattle's Aurora Bridge, the Fremont Troll has become one of the city's most beloved public art installations. This massive mixed-media sculpture depicts a giant troll clutching an actual Volkswagen Beetle, emerging from the earth as if caught in the act of crawling out from under the bridge.

## Creation and Artists

The Troll came to life in 1990 as the winner of a competition held by the Fremont Arts Council. Four local artists - Steve Badanes, Will Martin, Donna Walter, and Ross Whitehead - collaborated on the project, with significant help from the community. The sculpture was unveiled on Halloween 1990, a fitting debut for this whimsical guardian. The artists retain copyright of the Troll's image, managing its use through permissions for commercial applications while allowing free use for non-profit purposes.

## Artistic Details

Standing 18 feet tall, the Troll is constructed from steel rebar, wire, and concrete, demonstrating both artistic vision and engineering expertise. Its most distinctive feature is an actual Volkswagen Beetle clutched in its left hand, complete with California license plates. The car is filled with concrete and permanently incorporated into the sculpture, creating a unique mixed-media element that adds to the installation's whimsical narrative.

## Cultural Impact

The Troll has become more than just a piece of public art - it's a symbol of Fremont's creative spirit and Seattle's artistic culture. In 2005, the segment of Aurora Avenue North under the bridge was officially renamed "Troll Avenue" in its honor. The sculpture has appeared in numerous films, television shows, and photographs, becoming one of Seattle's most photographed landmarks.

## Community Connection

The area around the Troll has evolved into a gathering place for both locals and tourists. The sculpture embodies Fremont's unofficial motto of "De Libertas Quirkas" (Freedom to be Peculiar) and stands as a testament to the neighborhood's artistic heritage and community involvement in public art.

## Visiting the Troll

Located at N. 36th Street at Troll Avenue N., under the north end of the Aurora Bridge, the Troll is accessible 24 hours a day. While the sculpture itself is impressive during daylight hours, nighttime lighting creates an especially atmospheric experience, though visitors should exercise appropriate caution during evening visits.
