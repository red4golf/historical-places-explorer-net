# Fort Casey: Sentinel of Puget Sound

As you stand atop the grassy bluff at Fort Casey, the salty breeze carries whispers of a bygone era. This coastal fortification, once a key player in the defense of Puget Sound, now stands as a silent sentinel, inviting you to explore its rich history.

Built in the late 1890s, Fort Casey was part of the "Triangle of Fire," a trio of forts designed to protect the entrance to Puget Sound. As you walk among the massive concrete gun emplacements, imagine the thunderous roar of the disappearing guns, capable of firing 600-pound projectiles up to 8 miles out to sea.

The fort's strategic importance grew during both World Wars. Peer into the ammunition magazines and plotting rooms, where soldiers once calculated firing solutions using complex mechanical computers. These windowless chambers, now quiet, once bustled with activity during tense moments of coastal watch.

Don't miss the iconic Admiralty Head Lighthouse, standing proudly since 1903. Climb its spiral staircase for a panoramic view of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where Spanish explorers once sailed and Native American tribes fished for centuries.

As you explore, notice how nature is slowly reclaiming parts of the fort. Wild grasses sway where parade grounds once stood, and the cries of seabirds have replaced the shouts of drill sergeants.

Fort Casey's story is one of constant adaptation. From coastal defense to World War II training ground, to its current role as a state park, it has always stood watch over these waters. Today, it offers not just a glimpse into military history, but a peaceful haven for picnickers, kite flyers, and history enthusiasts alike.

As you leave, take a moment to appreciate the fort's enduring presence. Like the steadfast lighthouse beam, Fort Casey continues to guide us â€“ not through treacherous waters, but through the currents of our shared past.
