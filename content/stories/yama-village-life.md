# Life in Yama Village

Walking along this beach today, you would never know that one of the largest Japanese communities in the Pacific Northwest once thrived here. From 1883 to 1922, Yama Village was home to hundreds of Japanese mill workers and their families.

## Village Layout

The village stretched along the hillside in a series of terraces. Japanese-style houses and gardens clung to the slope, connected by wooden stairs and pathways. At its peak, over 300 people called Yama home.

## Daily Life

Residents created a self-contained community with:
- A general store
- Community bath house
- Buddhist temple
- Baseball field
- Gardens growing Japanese vegetables

## Cultural Center

Yama wasn't just housing - it was a cultural hub for Japanese immigrants throughout the Puget Sound. Festivals, ceremonies, and celebrations brought visitors from as far as Seattle and Tacoma.

## What to Look For

Today, careful observers might spot:
- Old foundation stones
- Remnants of garden terraces
- Cherry trees descended from original plantings
- Bits of pottery and household items in the soil
