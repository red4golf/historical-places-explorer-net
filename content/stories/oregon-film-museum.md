# Oregon Film Museum: Where History Meets Hollywood

Housed in the historic Old Clatsop County Jail in Astoria, the Oregon Film Museum celebrates the state's rich filmmaking legacy while preserving a significant piece of local history. This unique museum occupies a building that served as both a working jail from 1914 to 1976 and a filming location for the iconic opening scene of "The Goonies."

## Historical Building

Built in 1913, the Old Clatsop County Jail is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building's distinctive architecture and history as a working correctional facility add an authentic backdrop to its current role as a museum. Its most famous cell, Number 2, gained notoriety through its appearance in "The Goonies" and remains a popular photo opportunity for visitors.

## Film Heritage

The museum showcases Oregon's extensive film history, with special emphasis on movies filmed in Astoria, including:
- "The Goonies" (1985)
- "Kindergarten Cop" (1990)
- "Short Circuit" (1986)
- "Free Willy" (1993)

## Interactive Experience

Today's visitors can explore both the building's law enforcement history and Oregon's film legacy through:

## Cultural Impact

The museum, located at 732 Duane Street, has become a vital cultural institution, drawing over 52,000 visitors annually. It stands as a testament to both Astoria's role in film history and the preservation of local heritage, bridging the gap between the city's past as a frontier town and its present as a cultural destination.
