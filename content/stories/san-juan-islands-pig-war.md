# The Pig War: When One Pig Almost Started a War

Here on San Juan Island, a pig once nearly sparked a war between two great powers. In 1859, an American settler named Lyman Cutlar shot a British-owned pig that was rooting in his potato patch. This seemingly minor incident escalated into an international crisis that brought Britain and the United States to the brink of war.

The real issue wasn't about the pig—it was about the border. Both nations claimed the San Juan Islands, and both had settlers here. After Cutlar shot the pig, the British authorities threatened to arrest him, and American settlers called for military protection. Soon, the island hosted two armed camps: American soldiers at American Camp on the south end, and British Royal Marines at English Camp to the north.

The standoff that followed was remarkable for its civility. While officially in a state of military occupation, the troops developed friendly relations. They visited each other's camps for holidays and celebrations, held athletic competitions, and even shared resources during harsh winters.

For 13 years, the two forces maintained their posts while diplomats sought a solution. Finally, in 1872, an international arbitrator—Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany—ruled in favor of the United States. The British withdrew, leaving behind gardens, formal lawns, and a tradition of afternoon tea that persisted among island residents.

Today, you can visit both camps. At English Camp, you'll find a formal garden, preserved barracks, and a cemetery. American Camp offers prairie views reminiscent of what the soldiers saw, along with remnants of the military buildings. Together, they stand as monuments to how international disputes can be resolved without bloodshed.

This peaceful resolution set a precedent for British-American relations and international arbitration. The only casualty of the Pig War was the pig itself—proof that sometimes the best battles are the ones that never happen.
