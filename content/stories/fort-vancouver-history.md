# Fort Vancouver: Gateway to the Pacific Northwest

Standing on these grounds, you're at what was once the most important European settlement in the Pacific Northwest. Fort Vancouver served as the Hudson's Bay Company's main fur trading post west of the Rocky Mountains from 1824 to 1849.

The fort you see today is a careful reconstruction, showing how this bustling trade center appeared in the 1840s. At its height, Fort Vancouver was more than just a trading post—it was a complete community with a school, library, chapel, and gardens. The fort's Chief Factor, John McLoughlin, became known as the "Father of Oregon" for his role in helping American settlers.

Inside the fort's walls, you would have found a fascinating mix of cultures. Native Americans traded furs, British and French-Canadian trappers brought their catches, and Hawaiian workers (known as Kanakas) helped operate the fort. The trade language was Chinook Jargon, a mixture of Native American, English, and French words.

The fort's influence extended far beyond trade. Its large farm and orchards made it the first large-scale agricultural operation in the region. The sawmill supplied lumber to build ships. Blacksmiths forged tools needed for the growing settlement.

When the U.S.-British border was established at the 49th parallel in 1846, Fort Vancouver's importance began to decline. The U.S. Army established Vancouver Barracks here in 1849, marking a new chapter in the site's history.

As you explore the reconstructed buildings, imagine the activity of fur traders, the sounds of multiple languages, and the smell of smoke from the blacksmith's forge—all part of daily life at this crucial crossroads of Pacific Northwest history.
