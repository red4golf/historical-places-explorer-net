# Draft Locations

This directory contains draft location submissions from users. These locations need to be reviewed before being moved to the main locations directory.

## Process

1. Users submit locations through the "Add Location" button
2. Submissions are stored here as JSON files
3. Each file contains:
   - Basic location info (name, coordinates)
   - Notes from the submitter
   - Timestamp and draft status

## Review Steps

1. Check the location accuracy
2. Verify historical significance
3. Add additional required metadata
4. Move to main locations directory when complete

## File Naming

Files are automatically named with pattern: `loc_[timestamp].json`

Example: `loc_1701234567890.json`
