Historical Places Explorer - Project Guide
Project Overview
Historical Places Explorer is Charles Einarson's interactive local history platform, initiated in December 2023. The platform aims to make local history discoverable and engaging by connecting physical locations with their historical significance.
Core Philosophy
Vision

Make history discoverable where it happened
Enable people to "walk the paths and hear the stories"
Focus on everyday locations and their hidden histories
Connect physical places with their historical significance

Development Approach

Start small, focused on Bainbridge Island initially
Build incrementally - deliberately scaled back initial plans
Let content drive development - historical stories lead technical needs
Local-first approach - everything stores locally before cloud/GitHub

Technical Implementation
Architecture

Local file storage using JSON and Markdown
React/Vite for fast development
Mapbox for mapping integration
Simple, expandable data structure

Location data in JSON (coordinates, basic info)
Full story in Markdown
Links to related locations
Support for multiple media types

Guidelines for Development
Core Principles

Build tools that enhance historical research and writing
Keep data formats simple and portable
Focus on storytelling capabilities
Make it easy to add new content

Feature Development
Any new features should:

Serve the core purpose of making history accessible
Support the local-first approach
Enhance storytelling capabilities
Maintain simple data structures

Content Requirements

Location data should be comprehensive but concise
Stories should connect place with history
Media should enhance understanding
Cross-references should create historical context

Remember
This is fundamentally a tool for making local history accessible and engaging. Technical decisions should always serve this core purpose.
